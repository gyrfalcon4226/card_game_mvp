        <h1>Card Battle Game</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Card Battle Game! Here are the basic rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Each player draws 5 cards from a deck of cards.</li>
            <li>Each card has an attack and health value, and a special suit effect.</li>
            <li>During each turn, both players select one card to battle.</li>
            <li>The card with higher attack value reduces the opponent's card health.</li>
            <li>If a card's health drops to zero or below, it is removed from play.</li>
            <li>Special suit effects:
                <ul>
                    <li>Spade: Counterattack - Deals half of its attack as damage back to the attacker.</li>
                    <li>Heart: Lifesteal - Heals for half of its attack when it deals damage.</li>
                    <li>Diamond: Shield - Gains shield equal to half of its attack each turn.</li>
                    <li>Club: Poison - Deals half of its attack as poison damage over two turns.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The game ends when one player has no more cards left.</li>
        </ul>
